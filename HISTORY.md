## [2026-03-15] YOLO Refactor: Consolidation of Chat Logic (Issue #459)
- Consolidated message-related logic into `useMessageState`, incorporating history, blocks, and scroll refs.
- Merged messaging and shortcut logic into `useChatActions`.
- Simplified `useChatScreenController` by reducing the number of direct hook calls and improving delegation.
- Removed redundant hooks: `useChatHistory`, `useChatMessaging`, `useChatScrollRefs`.
- Verified with linting, type-checking, and regression tests.

## [2026-03-15] Refactor ChatScreen Controller (Issue #459)
- Split `useChatScreenController.ts` into multiple functional hooks:
  - `useAgentSelection`
  - `useChatNavigation`
  - `useMessageState`
  - `useChatSession`
  - `useChatScroll`
  - `useChatScreenFocusEffects`
  - `useChatInput`
  - `useChatActions`
  - `useChatStates`
  - `useA2AIntegration`
  - `useChatScreenEssentials`
  - `useChatModalStates`
  - `useChatShortcut`
- Updated `useChatScreenController` to orchestrate these hooks.
- Fixed duplicate `AllowlistError` in `frontend/lib/api/client.ts`.
- Improved null-safety and robust error handling in `frontend/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` and `frontend/lib/config.ts`.
- Verified changes with linting, type checking, and tests.

## 2026-03-15 06:15 (EDT)
- Refactored `useChatScreenController.ts` (Issue #459) to improve maintainability and encapsulation:
  - Extracted domain-specific logic into new functional hooks: `useChatUI` (UI settings and modals) and `useChatHistory` (message state and pagination).
  - Introduced `useChatMessaging` to encapsulate input handling and message sending.
  - Redesigned `useChatScreenController` to return a structured, namespaced object (`navigation`, `ui`, `history`, `input`, `scroll`, `a2a`, `modals`, `actions`).
  - Updated `ChatScreen.tsx` to use the new structured interface, significantly cleaning up component property access.
  - Refined `useChatScroll` by removing unused parameters and properly integrating `loadMore` callback for auto-paging on scroll.
  - Introduced `useChatScrollRefs` to break circular dependencies between scroll and history hooks.
  - Verified changes with `npm run lint` and `npm run check-types`.

### 2026-03-15 06:40 (Swival)
- Flattened `useChatScreenController.ts` by directly orchestrating functional hooks: `useAgentSelection`, `useChatHistory`, `useChatScroll`, `useChatMessaging`, `useChatActions`, `useA2AIntegration`, etc.
- Removed redundant middle-layer meta-hooks (`useChatDisplayState.ts`, `useChatNavigationState.ts`, `useChatOperationState.ts`), improving code transparency and reducing nesting depth.
- Simplified internal prop passing by leveraging direct hook returns.
- Verified with linting and type checks (#459).

### 2026-03-15 07:25 (Swival) - Refactor: Logic Consolidation
- Merged `useChatScreenFocusEffects` logic directly into `useChatScroll` to centralize all scroll-related side effects (#459).
- Merged `useChatScreenEssentials` into `useChatUI` to simplify UI state management.
- Cleaned up `useChatScreenController.ts` by removing redundant hook orchestration.
- Standardized `useChatScroll` with an options object signature for better readability and maintainability.
- Verified with type checks and linting.
