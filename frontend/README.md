# a2a-client-hub (frontend)

Frontend for **a2a-client-hub**. Designed for cross-platform support (Expo / React Native / Web).

## Location

This frontend lives in `frontend/`. The backend lives in `backend/`.

## Tech Stack

- Expo
- React Native + React Native Web
- Expo Router
- NativeWind
- Zustand
- TanStack Query
- TypeScript

## Routing Conventions

This project uses Expo Router (React Navigation). The main app area uses `Tabs` (Agents/Sessions/Jobs) as the global navigation.

- Prefer `router.push()` to keep navigation history (mobile back gesture/back button, browser back).
- Use `router.replace()` only for redirects where returning to the previous screen should be prevented.
- For custom headers, a safe back strategy is:
  - `router.canGoBack() ? router.back() : router.replace("/")`

## Authentication

Authentication conventions are shared between frontend and backend:

- See `docs/authentication.md`.

## Environment

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is required for Web and Native.
  - Recommended: `https://<your-api-host>/api/v1`
  - Web-only (same-origin reverse proxy): `/api/v1`

## OpenCode Extension (Sessions/Messages)

If an A2A agent advertises the OpenCode session query extension (via Agent Card),
the app exposes an "OpenCode" entry from the Agents list to browse:

- OpenCode sessions (paginated)
- Messages within a session (paginated)

The frontend treats the upstream result as a passthrough envelope and avoids
binding to OpenCode-private schemas.
